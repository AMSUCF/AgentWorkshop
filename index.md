# Agentic AI & the Future of Digital Making

**Workshop by Anastasia Salter**

## About This Workshop

This workshop explores agentic AI as a cultural technology reshaping software, interfaces, and labor. Using a digital humanities lens, we'll consider:

- Distinctions between agentic and generative AI
- Uses of agents in context (Perplexity.AI's Comet and Claude Code)
- Practical research and digital making applications
