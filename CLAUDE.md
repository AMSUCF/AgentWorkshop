# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

AgentWorkshop is a curated resource collection focused on Agentic AI and the Future of Digital Making. This is a documentation repository maintained by Anastasia Salter, containing links to demos, examples, and further reading materials related to agentic AI in education and digital humanities.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of a single primary file:

- **index.md** - Main resource page containing:
  - Demos and Examples section with links to Claude Code workflows, educational demos, and WordPress integrations
  - Further Reading section with articles, blog posts, and educational materials on agentic AI

## Content Organization

The index.md file is organized into two main sections:

1. **Demos and Examples**: Working implementations and practical demonstrations of agentic AI tools
2. **Further Reading**: Articles, blog posts, and educational resources for deeper understanding

When updating this repository, maintain this two-section structure and ensure links are current and functional.

## Development Workflow

Since this is a documentation-only repository with no build system or dependencies:

- Edit index.md directly to add/update resources
- No build, test, or lint commands are needed
- Verify all links are functional before committing
- Maintain the existing markdown formatting style
